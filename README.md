# Read Me First

This project was developed as a tutorial on how to build a Spring Boot RESTful web service.

This project showcases:
* How to implement GET, POST, PUT and DELETE controller methods
* How to return the correct HTTP response codes
* How to test the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE controller methods
* The "Controller-Service-Repository" pattern
* The use of Lombok to reduce boiler plate code
* How to use an in-memory H2 database
* The dependencies required to support REST in Spring Boot
* How to interact with controller methods using cURL
